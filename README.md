# NAFF_UV
The NAFF_UV code is an implementation of the Jacques Laskar's NAFF algorithm.

This new version (NAFF_UV) can be seen as an updated and enhanced version of Jacques Laskar's original NAFF that was written in Fortran 77 and of a later version used in Bmad (https://github.com/MichaelEhrlichman/FortNAFF) and written in Fortran 90.

NAFF_UV is written in Fortran 2008 and there is a dependence on FFTW libraries (http://www.fftw.org/).
